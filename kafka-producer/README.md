# PROTEUS Kafka Producer & Consumer

This project contains all the stuff needed to read and write data to Kafka.

[KafkaConsumer](https://github.com/proteus-h2020/KafkaConsumerProducer/blob/master/KafkaConsumer/README.md)


## Getting started
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
mvn clean package
```
This command builds both the kafka consumer and the producer. While the consumer is designed to be executed as an isolated and background JAR application, the consumer is packaged under a WAR project. See more details here:
